# Trello REST API testing with Postman
## :mag_right: About project
The project was made during self-study and the course "Software Testing in Practice" prepared by Rafal Podraza. 
I created this project in order to practice, consolidate the acquired knowledge and document my skills.
During this challenge I learned the basics of REST API testing, became familiar with the Postman tool, created my own collection based on Trello documentation and made scripts for test automation.

The result of the project is a collection of Trello REST API tests performed in the Postman tool.
